This is a collection of all maps that I've made using R. 

The project is called [**#30DayMapChallenge**](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) and it is taken every year in November. Each day brings a new map, revealing different aspects of our world through data visualization. It's a creative journey that transforms numbers and information into eye-catching maps.

Explore this collection with me as we dive into maps that tell unique stories.
