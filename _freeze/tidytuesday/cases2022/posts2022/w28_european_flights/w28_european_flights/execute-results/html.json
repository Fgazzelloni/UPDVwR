In short, it is a network graph connecting diffent groups with a ribbon. A few things that made me think about a lot were the requirenment for the type of data to combine, the consequent label results, and the grouping. \n\nSo, let's have a go in making a **Sankey**.\n\n\nHave a quick look at the data for European flights:\n\nLoad the {tidyverse} and the data from: [#TidyTuesday GitHub repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-07-12)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflights <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-12/flights.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nJus a little cleaning for this type of data with `janitor::clean_names()` function, and it's ready to use.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflights <- flights%>%\n  janitor::clean_names()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe best way is to select a subgroup among the list of the European countries in the data set, and represent the diversity in aerial traffic.\n\nAs an example I choose Ukraine airports, and found that there is only one airoprt for Ukraine in the dataset. But, the interesting thing is that it covers on average almost the same aerial traffic of other European countries such as Italy which is provided with a far larger number of airports, in this dataset.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflights %>%\n  filter(state_name == \"Ukraine\") %>%\n  count(state_name,apt_name)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare Italy median of the total number of flights by airports with the only available airport aerial traffic in Ukraine:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflights %>%\n  filter(state_name %in% c(\"Ukraine\",\"Italy\")) %>%\n  count(state_name,pivot_label,flt_tot_1) %>%\n  group_by(state_name) %>%\n  summarize(total_median = median(flt_tot_1)) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe results of this preliminary data exploration arise a question:\n\n## Does the number of airports influence countries' aerial traffic?\n\n---\n\n### Waffle\n\nMake the first part of the visualization as a series of waffle, one for each selected country to show the diferences in number of airports.\n\nSelected are 6 countries with a varied number of airports and flights, this is done to give the idea of the differences.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- flights%>%\n  filter(state_name %in% c(\"Ukraine\",\"Belgium\",\"France\",\"Italy\",\"Spain\",\"United Kingdom\")) %>%\n  group_by(state_name) %>%\n  count(apt_name,sort=T) %>%\n  mutate(apt_id = seq(1,length(state_name),1)) %>%\n  summarise(tot = max(apt_id)) %>%\n  arrange(-tot)\n\ndf\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLoad both libraries {waffle} and {ggsankey} to use a feature in the waffle which is provided by the ggsankey package.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggsankey)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe waffles shows the number of airports for the selected countries on a total of 100.\nTo make the waffle we can safetly use the geom_waffle() layer\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwaffle <- df %>%\n  mutate(rr = 100 -
