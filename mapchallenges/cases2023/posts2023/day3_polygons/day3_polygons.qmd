           annotation=c("In 1998, Colombia faced a notable challenge with malaria incidence. While the disease persisted in many parts of the country, the situation was relatively better compared to some high-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria incidence rates were significant, but they were considerably lower than those reported in some of the hardest-hit regions globally. Despite this relatively lower burden, malaria remained a concern in Colombia, and efforts to combat the disease were still critical. The country, like many others, continued to work on strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, with a focus on reducing the impact of this infectious disease on its population."))
